# Disease Prediction from Symptoms

A robust system where users enter their symptoms, and the model predicts the possible disease. This project aims to assist in early disease detection and provide insights for medical consultation.

## Features

- **Symptom Input**: Users can enter multiple symptoms they are experiencing.
- **Disease Prediction**: The model analyzes the symptoms and predicts the most likely disease.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy input and output visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disease-Prediction-from-Symptoms.git
    cd Disease-Prediction-from-Symptoms
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

- Open the app in your browser.
- Enter the symptoms you are experiencing.
- View the predicted disease and possible next steps.

## Architecture

1. **Frontend**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
2. **Backend**: Utilizes a machine learning model trained on symptom and disease data to predict diseases.
3. **Database**: Stores symptom-disease mappings and user input data for analysis and improvement.
